write me a 500 word chapter following this outline, make sure to use the information above to ensure cohenrency with the rest of the story:
Bullet Point 2: Villain's Murder Attempt and Tobias' Intervention
Detail Cruella's attempt to kill Tobias' parent, her motivations, and her methods (e.g., using magic or other means).
Describe Tobias' struggle to stop Cruella and save his parent, showcasing his resourcefulness and determination.
Use comedic situations and funny quips outside of the tense conflict to lighten the mood and maintain a lighthearted tone.
Establish Tobias' moral dilemma: killing Cruella might make him similar to her, but he must protect his parent.
